how will we understand the requirement
Ans:
We will not going to get and ui we get first document
FRS DOCUMENT and based on that we will going to preparea test plan and test scenarios

Mockup screens - dummy screens in your documents
Testing life cycle (Identify scenarios, prepare test plan, write test case, prepare rtm, 
test case execution, defect tracking, test case execution report, retrospect meeting)
Identify the scenarios 2 days get doubt talk to developer , designer, manager
prepare test plan = 
write test case = 


Product is developed by the company
their are two types of layers
Frontend and backend
Frontend application can be seen Through internet publicly  they are internet applications
and The backend part that is only visible to admin and it is private they are
intranet applications.
We just test applications frontend

From our understanding we believe above functional areas need to be testeed

Test plan created by test lead
Test enviroment 
windows 10
Chrome browser

Exclusions
Features are need not to be tested

all the features 
all the third party features or payment gateways
Test automation


Test strategy

Step 1 Creation of test scenarios and test cases for the different features in scope

We will apply several test design techniques while creating test cases
Equivalence class partition
Boundry value analysis
Decision table testing
State transition testing
use case testing

We also use our expertise in creating test cases by applying the below:
Error guessing
Exploratory testing

We prioritise the test cases

Step 2:
Our testing process when we get an application for testing
1. Firstly we will perform smoke testing to check whether the different and important functionalities
of the applications are working.
2. We reject the build if the smoke testing fails and will wait for the stable build before 
performing in depth testing the functionalities of an application
3. Once we recieve a stable build which passes smoke testing, we perform In depth testing using
the test cases created.
4. Multiple resources will be testing the same Apllication on multiple supported Enviroments
simultaneously.
5. We then report the bugs in bug tracking tool and send you the defect found on that day in a 
status and end of the day email
6. will perform smoke and sanity regression and restesting, usabiltiy functionlity and ui testing
